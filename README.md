### Objective

To increase the safety and security of people using Smart AI CCTV Surveillance. And system can be run efficiently and accurately with minimum hardware cost.

### Problem

In today's world, safety and security are the utmost priority for everyone. We have seen there are various cases of thefts, violence, and crimes that are increasing day by day. there are many places where people don't think of going because they are not safe and people living there are always afraid. And we have seen many incidents around the world that if there is some crime being committed and nobody is there to help. So, in these cases, AI Surveillance comes out to be the most beneficial. This is one of the biggest problems in the world which needs to be solved.

### Solution

Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning (Computer Vision), to build a Smart AI CCTV Surveillance System which can easily, efficiently, and accurately detect various types of violence, crimes, thefts, and unusual activity. And alerts the Police or the concerned authorities about the incident immediately with the <b> Live Location and Live Image of the incident through Call, SMS, and Email. </b> This system will be fast and accurate that within few seconds of the incident the Police will get to know about the crime with location and the Intensity o the crime through the Live Image and make their necessary preparations before coming. So, it will not include any human interaction so there is no chance of delay reporting or human error. Moreover, the Live Image can be used as the Proof of Crime at the Incident and it will also help in catching the criminals.
